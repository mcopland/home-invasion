# Home Invasion

A one-player, text-based game where the user moves through the environment to collect items for a final confrontation.

## Gameplay

The player begins in the main room and is provided with options for how to continue. With a set number of steps and health the user searches each room to collect necessary items, weapons, and armor to progress. Ultimately the player battles the final boss if all steps are completed within the time limit.
